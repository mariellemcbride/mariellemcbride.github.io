        <p>Did you know? Cats purr at a frequency between 25 and 150 Hertz. This frequency is when bones and muscles grow and repair themselves.</p>
        <p>Did you also know? Cats sweat through their paws. Because they are covered in fur, there are very few places that they can sweat. Most of their sweat glands are on their paws.</p>
